== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Burst really free? =
Yes. Burst Statistics is 100% free with no tracking limits. Pro is optional for users who need advanced features like UTM tracking, revenue attribution, geographic data or reporting. That's how we can keep Burst Statistics Free for most users. 

= Is Burst a good Google Analytics alternative? =
Yes. If you find GA4 too complex or are concerned about sending visitor data to Google, Burst is the perfect replacement. You get the statistics you actually need - visitors, referrers, top pages, conversions - without the overwhelm.

= Where is the data stored? =
All statistics are stored in your own WordPress database. Unlike Google Analytics or cloud-based tools, we have zero access to your data. It never leaves your server.

= Does Burst slow down my website? =
No. Burst is built for performance with optimized database queries, minimal tracking scripts, and Turbo Mode if speed is more important than accuracy. Your site stays fast.

= Do I need a cookie consent banner? =
Not necessarily. Burst has a cookieless tracking mode that's fully GDPR/CCPA compliant without requiring consent. If you prefer cookie-based tracking for higher accuracy, Burst integrates seamlessly with Complianz and other consent plugins.

= How is Burst different from WP Statistics or Independent Analytics? =
Burst focuses on clarity over quantity. While other plugins can feel cluttered and overwhelming, Burst's dashboard is designed to show you what matters without the noise. Users consistently mention our clean, intuitive interface as the reason they switched.

= Can I use Burst alongside Google Analytics? =
Yes. Many users run both during a transition period or keep GA4 for historical data while using Burst for daily insights. There's no conflict.

= Does Burst Statistics use cookies? =
There is an option to use cookieless tracking if you prefer. But by default, Burst uses cookies because they are more accurate and lightweight. While using cookies, Burst remains privacy-friendly because all data is anonymous and stored on your server. Read more about [why cookies are misunderstood](https://burst-statistics.com/why-is-burst-privacy-friendly/#misunderstood-cookies).

= Does Burst work with WooCommerce? =
Yes. Basic pageview tracking works in the free version. For revenue tracking, product analytics, and sales attribution, you'll need Burst Pro.

= Can I track form submissions? =
Yes. Burst integrates with Gravity Forms, Contact Form 7, WPForms, Ninja Forms, Formidable Forms, WS Form, HappyForms, and Fluent Forms. Form submissions can be tracked as a goal.

= How do I migrate from another analytics plugin? =
Install and activate Burst — it starts tracking immediately. Historical data from other plugins can't be imported, but you can run both side-by-side during a transition period.
