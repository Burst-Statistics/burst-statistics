Analytics you'll actually use. Privacy-friendly, zero config, and designed to be actionable. Get insights, not just raw data.

== Description ==

= Finally, analytics that you'll actually use. =

Google Analytics is overkill. Other WordPress statistics plugins are cluttered and confusing. You just want to know what's happening on your site - without a data science degree.

Burst Statistics gives you a clean, intuitive analytics dashboard focused on the metrics that actually matter. **No external accounts. No complex setup. Install, activate, and understand your traffic in seconds.**

Trusted by **200,000+ WordPress sites**. Built by the experienced team behind UpdraftPlus, WP-Optimize, and All-In-One Security.

= Why Burst Statistics? =

**Designed to be actionable**
Other analytics plugins throw everything at you. Burst shows what matters — visitors, pageviews, referrers, top pages — in a dashboard you'll actually use. No overload of data. No confusing menus.

**Privacy-first by design**
All statistics stay on your server. No external tracking. Your data is yours - we never see it without your explicit permission.

**Zero setup friction**
Install, activate, done. No Google accounts, no tracking codes, no configuration headaches. Start seeing live visitors immediately.

**Built for WordPress**
Not a port from another platform. Designed specifically for WordPress with native performance and seamless integration.

**Fast and lightweight**
Optimized database queries, no bloated scripts (<4kb tracking script), no external dependencies slowing down your pages. Designed to track accurately even when using aggressive server-side caching.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is Burst really free? =
Yes. Burst Statistics is 100% free with no tracking limits. Pro is optional for users who need advanced features like UTM tracking, revenue attribution, geographic data or reporting. That's how we can keep Burst Statistics Free for most users.

= Where is the data stored? =
All statistics are stored in your own WordPress database. Unlike Google Analytics or cloud-based tools, we have zero access to your data. Your data never leaves your server, unless you manually opt in to share anonymous usage insights with us.

= Is Burst a good Google Analytics alternative? =
Yes. If you find GA4 too complex or are concerned about sending visitor data to Google, Burst is the perfect replacement. You get the statistics you actually need - visitors, referrers, top pages, conversions - without the overwhelm.

= Do I need an account? =
No, you don’t need an account; no data is sent to another website.

= Is there a limit to the number of visitors I can track? =
No, there is no limit. The only limiting factor is your own database and server.

= Does Burst Statistics use cookies? =
There is an option to use cookieless tracking if you prefer. But by default, Burst uses cookies because they are more accurate and lightweight. While using cookies, Burst remains privacy-friendly because all data is anonymous and stored on your server. Read more about [why cookies are misunderstood](https://burst-statistics.com/why-is-burst-privacy-friendly/#misunderstood-cookies).

= What is Cookieless tracking? =
Burst Statistics can be used without setting cookies or storing data in browsers. However, this can affect accuracy, so a hybrid option with cookies after consent is possible. Read more about [Cookieless tracking](https://burst-statistics.com/definition/what-is-cookieless-tracking/).

= Why is Burst Statistics Privacy-Friendly? =
Burst Statistics provides an Analytics Dashboard with anonymised data that is yours and yours alone. Read more about [Why Burst Statistics is Privacy-Friendly](https://burst-statistics.com/why-is-burst-privacy-friendly/).

= How is Burst different from WP Statistics or Independent Analytics? =
Burst focuses on clarity over quantity. While other plugins can feel cluttered and overwhelming, Burst's dashboard is designed to show you what matters without the noise. Users consistently mention our clean, intuitive interface as the reason they switched.

= Can I use Burst alongside Google Analytics? =
Yes. Many users run both during a transition period or keep GA4 for historical data while using Burst for daily insights. There's no conflict.

= Does Burst Statistics slow down my website? ? =
No. Burst is built for performance with optimized database queries, minimal tracking scripts, and Turbo Mode if speed is more important than accuracy. Your site stays fast.

= Does Burst work with WooCommerce? =
Yes. Basic pageview tracking works in the free version. For revenue tracking, product analytics, and sales attribution, you'll need Burst Pro.

= How do I migrate from another analytics plugin? =
Install and activate Burst — it starts tracking immediately. Historical data from other plugins can't be imported, but you can run both side-by-side during a transition period.

= Is it possible to install Burst Statistics with Composer? =
Absolutely! Both free and premium plugins can be managed with Composer. Read the [documentation](https://burst-statistics.com/installing-burst-statistics-with-composer/) for more information.

= Can I give feedback about the plugin? =
We value your feedback. You can [submit a support request on the WordPress forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/burst-statistics/), and we will respond promptly.
