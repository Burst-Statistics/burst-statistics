= What users are saying =

> "I tried WP Statistics and Independent Analytics, but they're overloaded and confusing. Burst's UI is intuitive and focused on what matters to me."
> — @vallered on wordpress.org

> "On-premise analytics is a great, if not the best, alternative to Google Analytics in the GDPR era. Since it's native to WordPress, it's so easy to configure Goals. That's awesome."
> — Daan from Daan.dev

> "Finally, an analytics plugin I can actually explain to clients. The charts are visual, data is real-time, and the integration with WooCommerce is excellent."

**Clean UI, not cluttered dashboards**
Other analytics plugins throw everything at you. Burst shows what matters — visitors, pageviews, referrers, top pages — in a dashboard you'll actually use. No overload of data. No confusing menus.

**Privacy-first by design**
All statistics stay on your server. No external tracking. Optional cookieless mode for full GDPR compliance without consent banners. Your data is yours - we never see it without your explicit permission.

**Zero setup friction**
Install, activate, done. No Google accounts, no tracking codes, no configuration headaches. Start seeing live visitors immediately.

**Built for WordPress**
Not a port from another platform. Designed specifically for WordPress with native performance and seamless integration.

Optimized database queries, minimal scripts, no external dependencies slowing down your pages.
